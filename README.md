# comparch
my comparch latex written course

## Note from a contributor

I would like to thank the student who is writing and sharing his notes for the Computer Architecture course. To simplify things, I create a Github Actions workflow so that whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch, it will automatically compile the latex and place it in the `gh-pages` branch.
Then, the PDF is accessible from a direct link.
In my case, in the forked repository, it is accessible at [https://animarcus.github.io/comparch/comparch.pdf](). (If it works correctly, it should also be accessible from [https://animarcus.github.io/comparch/]()
However, the author of this project might adapt it to his own links.
