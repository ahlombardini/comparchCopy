# comparch
my comparch latex written course

## Note from a contributor

I would like to thank the student who is writing and sharing his notes for the Computer Architecture course. To simplify things, I create a Github Actions workflow so that whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch, it will automatically compile the latex and place it in the `gh-pages` branch.
Then, the PDF is accessible from a direct link.
It is accessible at [https://elazdi-al.github.io/comparch/index.html](https://elazdi-al.github.io/comparch/)
